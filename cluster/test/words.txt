Canadian media theorist Marshall McLuhan famously argued that the
purpose of media studies was to make visible that which normally remains
invisible ‒ namely, the effects of media technologies rather than the messages
they convey. When he originally proposed this idea in the 1960s
McLuhan was widely celebrated as the great prophet of the media age, but
in the decades that followed his work gradually fell into disregard. In the
1970s, for example, Raymond Williams claimed that McLuhan’s ideas were
‘ludicrous’1 and Hans Magnus Enzensberger dismissed him as a ‘charlatan’
who was ‘incapable of any theoretical construction’ and who wrote with
‘provocative idiocy’.2 This tacit dismissal of McLuhan’s ideas was largely
accepted until the late twentieth century, when there was renewed interest
in his work among several German media theorists, such as Friedrich Kittler
and Norbert Bolz. Unlike the critics associated with the Birmingham Centre
for Contemporary Cultural Studies, who primarily focused on the content
of media texts and the interpretive work performed by media audiences,
these theorists applied epistemological and philosophical questions to the
study of media, which was largely inspired by McLuhan’s famous claim
that ‘the medium is the message’.3 Kittler even argued that ‘[w]ithout this
formula…media studies itself would not exist as such in isolation or with
any methodological clarity’.4 Kittler’s emphasis on the technical aspects of
media gradually became fashionable in intellectual circles, and it is now
widely known as ‘German media theory’. Some of the concepts and ideas
that are common to both Canadian and German media theory include
their focus on the materiality of communication, the notion of media as
prosthetic technologies or ‘extensions of man’, the concept of media ecology,
the impact of media technologies on the formation of subjectivity as
well as the military applications of media technologies. Although German
media theory has often been criticized for ignoring questions of content
and reception and for promoting a kind of technological determinism (as
was McLuhan and other critics associated with the Toronto School of Communication
Theory), it has also been described as one of Germany’s most
significant intellectual exports,5 and despite these criticisms the technical
aspects of media have once again become a central issue in the humanities.

Sybille Krämer is rarely mentioned in these discussions, as her work is
not widely known outside of Germany and it does not share the technical
emphasis that is widely seen as the hallmark of German media theory.
Nevertheless, her early work primarily focused on developing a philosophy
of technology and theorizing the function of the computer as a medium.
Krämer received a Ph.D. in philosophy at the Philipp University of Marburg
in 1980, and her doctoral thesis, Technik, Gesellschaft und Natur: Versuch
über ihren Zusammenhang (Technology, Society and Nature: An Attempt to
Explain their Relationship), outlined her earliest reflections on technology.
Beginning in 1984 she was also part of the ‘Mensch und Technik’ (Humans
and Technology) work group as well as the ‘Artificial Intelligence’ commission
of the Verein Deutscher Ingenieure (Society of German Engineers) in
Düsseldorf. In 1988 she published her second book, Symbolische Maschinen:
Die Idee der Formalisierung in geschichtlichem Abriss (Symbolic Machines:
A Historical Abstract on the Concept of Formalization), which investigated
the use of formalization, calculization, and mechanization in mathematics.
Krämer introduced the terms ‘symbolic machines’ and ‘operational scripts’
to refer to mathematical equations, as these equations are not readable
texts but rather executable processes. If concrete numerals are replaced by
letters, for example, it is possible to calculate using signs in a fundamentally
more abstract manner. The introduction of algebra thus made it possible to
use new signs for new operations, such as the introduction of differential
calculus, which made it possible to work with infinitesimally small values.
This book effectively expanded Krämer’s understanding of technology
by arguing that all mathematical equations are essentially mechanical
operations. In other words, Krämer did not attempt to provide a history of
the computer or even to suggest that the machine should be understood
as a manufactured object; rather, she suggested that the concept of the
machine was a result of the mediating function of symbols or the process
of ‘formalization’. Symbolische Maschinen thus signaled a shift from the
study of technological history to the study of intellectual history and from
the concept of technical operations to the concept of symbolic operations.
In 1989 Krämer became professor of theoretical philosophy at the
Institute of Philosophy at the Free University of Berlin, and in 1991 she
published her habilitation treatise Berechenbare Vernunft: Kalkül und
Rationalismus im 17. Jahrhundert (Computable Reason: Calculation and
Rationalism in the 17th Century). This book represented an extension of the
argument presented in her previous book by elaborating on the history of
the idea of computation, and it similarly focused on operations rather than
technologies. Berechenbare Vernunft can thus be seen as part of a similar

shift away from the technological a priori that shapes or determines medial
processes to the question of ‘mediality’ itself as a topic of philosophical
inquiry. Kramer’s divergence from the dominant trends in German media
theory at this time was made particularly apparent in her contribution to
the 1998 anthology Medien, Computer, Realität: Wirklichkeitsvorstellungen
und Neue Medien (Media, Computer, Reality: Perceptions of Reality and New
Media), in which she articulated a very different concept of media: ‘We do
not hear vibrations in the atmosphere but rather the sound of a bell; we do
not read letters but rather a story.’6 In other words, the medium is supposed
to be inaudible and invisible, and it only becomes apparent when it is not
functioning properly.
Krämer made a similar argument in her 2001 book, Sprache, Sprechakt,
Kommunikation: Sprachtheoretische Positionen des 20. Jahrhunderts (Language,
Speech Act, Communication: Theories of Language of the 20th Century),
which focused on the disembodied nature of speech acts:
